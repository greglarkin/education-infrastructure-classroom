  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <h5>Where can I find instructions for using the classroom tools?</h5>
  <p class="answer">
    We use a tool that allows each student to perform classroom exercises by writing code in a graphical editor and
    enforcing it on a virtualized agent node. Read the <a href="classroom_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.
  </p>

  <h5>Where can I find tutorials on using the Git server?</h5>
  <p class="answer">
    We run a self-hosted Git server called <a href="https://gitea.io">Gitea</a>. While it does not have very extensive
    end-user documentation, the experience is very close to that of GitHub. We suggest that if you want to practice
    your Git skills before class that you sign up for a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> and then try
    out <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">this tutorial</a>.
  </p>

  <h5>What firewall configuration is needed?</h5>
  <p class="answer">
    We run several services that you will need to be able to access via web browser. You may need to ask your network
    administrator to add rules allowing access.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Puppetfactory classroom manager: HTTP on port 80</li>
    <li>Puppet Enterprise Console and Remote Desktop web client: HTTPS on port 443</li>
    <li>Gitea Repository Server: HTTP on port 3000</li>
    <li>Courseware Presentation: HTTP and Websocket on port 9090</li>
    <li><a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362683-Network-Firewall-or-Proxy-Server-Settings-for-Zoom">Zoom.us
        network requirements</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="answer">Some requirements are optional, or provide alternative connection means.
    These optional access rules include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SSH login: SSH on port 22</li>
    <li>Remote Desktop: RDP on port 3389</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>What are the browser requirements?</h5>
  <p class="answer">Any modern browser should work. In general, we recommend one of the following.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Relatively current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or Safari.</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer version 11+</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Do I need to install a PDF reader?</h5>
  <p class="answer">
    Probably not. Most modern browsers have a PDF reader built-in or use a platform standard reader. If that is not the
    case for you, then readers such as <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html">Adobe Acrobat
      Reader</a> can be used free of charge.
  </p>

  <h5>How can I correct issues with the video conferencing (Zoom.us) system?</h5>
  <p class="answer">Check the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362683-Network-Firewall-or-Proxy-Server-Settings-for-Zoom">Zoom.us network requirements</a>. Their support portal might also have other suggestions.</p>

  <h5>How do I accept a self-signed certificate?</h5>
  <p class="answer">
      You can find official instructions in the <a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/accessing_console/console_accessing.html#accepting-the-console-certificate">Puppet
      Enterprise documentation</a>.
  </p>

  <h5>What if I can't accept a self-signed certificate?</h5>
  <p class="answer">Please let us know in the feedback form at the end of the tests. We may be able to help you.</p>
