  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <ul id="faq">
    <li>
      <h4>Where can I find instructions for using the classroom tools?</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We use a tool that allows each student to perform classroom exercises by writing code
          in a graphical editor and enforcing it on a virtualized agent node. Read the
          <a href="classroom_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

      <h4>Where can I find tutorials on using the Git server?</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We run a self-hosted Git server called <a href="https://gitea.io">Gitea</a>.
          While it does not have very extensive end-user documentation, the experience is very close to
          that of GitHub. We suggest that if you want to practice your Git skills before class that
          you sign up for a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> and then try out
          <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">this tutorial</a>.</p>

      <h4>What firewall configuration is needed?</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>We run several services that you will need to be able to access via web browser.
          You may need to ask your network administrator to add rules allowing access.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Puppetfactory classroom manager: HTTP on port 80</li>
          <li>Puppet Enterprise Console and Remote Desktop web client: HTTPS on port 443</li>
          <li>Gitea Repository Server: HTTP on port 3000</li>
          <li>Courseware Presentation: HTTP and Websocket on port 9090</li>
          <li><a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362683-Network-Firewall-or-Proxy-Server-Settings-for-Zoom">Zoom.us
              network requirements</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some requirements are optional, or provide alternative connection means.
          These optional access rules include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>SSH login: SSH on port 22</li>
          <li>Remote Desktop: RDP on port 3389</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>What are the browser requirements?</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Any modern browser should work. In general, we recommend one of the following.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Relatively current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, or Safari.</li>
          <li>Internet Explorer version 11+</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Do I need to install a PDF reader?</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Probably not. Most modern browsers have a PDF reader built-in or use a platform
          standard reader. If that is not the case for you, then readers such as
          <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>
          can be used free of charge.</p>

      <h4>How can I correct issues with the video conferencing (Zoom.us) system?</h4>
      <div class="answer">
        <p>Check the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362683-Network-Firewall-or-Proxy-Server-Settings-for-Zoom">Zoom.us
            network requirements</a>.

            Enterprise documentation</a>.</p>
