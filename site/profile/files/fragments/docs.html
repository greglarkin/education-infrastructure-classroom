    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <ul id="faq">
      <li>
        <h4>Where can I find instructions for using the classroom tools?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>We use a tool that allows each student to perform classroom exercises by writing code
            in a graphical editor and enforcing it on a virtualized agent node. Read the
            <a href="classroom_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Where can I find tutorials on using the Git server?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>We run a self-hosted Git server called <a href="https://gitea.io">Gitea</a>.
            While it does not have very extensive end-user documentation, the experience is very close to
            that of GitHub. We suggest that if you want to practice your Git skills before class that
            you sign up for a <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a> and then try out
            <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">this tutorial</a>.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>What firewall configuration is needed?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>We run several services that you will need to be able to access via web browser.
            You may need to ask your network administrator to add rules allowing access.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Puppetfactory classroom manager: HTTP on port 80</li>
            <li>Puppet Enterprise Console and Remote Desktop web client: HTTPS on port 443</li>
            <li>Gitea Repository Server: HTTP on port 3000</li>
            <li>Courseware Presentation: HTTP and Websocket on port 9090</li>
            <li><a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362683-Network-Firewall-or-Proxy-Server-Settings-for-Zoom">Zoom.us network requirements</a></li>
          </ul>

          <p>Some requirements are optional, or provide alternative connection means.
            These optional access rules include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>SSH login: SSH on port 22</li>
            <li>Remote Desktop: RDP on port 3389</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>What are the browser requirements?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Any modern browser should work. In general, we recommend one of the following.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Relatively current versions of Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>Internet Explorer version 11+</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>Do I need to install a PDF reader?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Probably not. Most modern browsers have a PDF reader built-in or use a platform
            standard reader. If that is not the case for you, then readers such as
            <a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/pdf-reader.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>
            can be used free of charge.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>How can I correct issues with the video conferencing (Zoom.us) system?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Check the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362683-Network-Firewall-or-Proxy-Server-Settings-for-Zoom">Zoom.us network requirements</a>.
            Their support portal might also have other suggestions.</p>

      <li><h4>How do I accept a self-signed certificate?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>You can find official instructions in the <a href="https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/accessing_console/console_accessing.html#accepting-the-console-certificate">Puppet Enterprise documentation</a>.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>What if I can't accept a self-signed certificate?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>Please let us know in the feedback form at the end of the tests. We may be able to help you.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>What can I do to mitigate a slow network?</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>If you have limited bandwidth accessible to you, then you can try some
            techniques to make the most of what you have.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Are there other locations you can work from? Perhaps your office has
              more bandwidth. Or perhaps home does!</li>
            <li>Try shutting down competing services. For example, if you normally stream
              music with Spotify or Pandora, you might try turning it off and only playing
              music locally if you need it.</li>
            <li>Try turning the camera off so that you're not streaming live video back
              to the instructor. It's always good to see who you're talking with, but
              it's better for the classroom to work!</li>
            <li>Try rebooting your router/modem. Sometimes they work better after a
              fresh start.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><h4>The classroom web terminal logged me out!</h4>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>In the quest for power efficiency and longer battery life, many browsers
            will suspend web pages when you've not actively working with them. This means
            that if the terminal is in a window or tab that you're not actively viewing,
            your browser might stop maintaining the connection.</p>
          <p>The Puppetfactory classroom manager will attempt to restore the connection
            when you come back to the page, but if it's been a very long time it may
            not be able to do so. While logging back in is a minor annoyance, you will
            not lose any work. If you have to do so more than once or twice a day,
            please let your instructor know.</p>
